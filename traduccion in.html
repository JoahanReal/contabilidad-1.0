         <h1>Calculation of cost</h1>
        
        <FONT SIZE=4.5>The cost or cost is the economic cost that represents the manufacture of a product or the provision of a service. When determining the cost of production, the sale price to the public of the good in question can be established (the price to the public is the sum of the cost plus the benefit). The cost of a product is formed by the price of the raw material, the price of direct labor used in its production, the price of indirect labor used for the operation of the company and the cost of amortization of machinery and buildings.

        The specialists affirm that many industralists usually establish their prices of sale based on the prices of the competitors, without before determining if these reach to cover their own costs. Therefore, a large number of businesses do not prosper as they do not obtain the necessary profitability for their operation. This reflects that the calculation of costs is essential for proper business management.


 
        The analysis of business costs allows knowing what, where, when, to what extent, how and why it happened, which enables a better management of the future.

        In other words, the cost is the economic effort that must be made to achieve an operational objective (the payment of salaries, the purchase of materials, the manufacture of a product, the obtaining of funds for financing, the administration of the company, etc.). When the desired objective is not achieved, it is said that a company has losses.

        <h2>cousin cost</h2>
        <FONT SIZE=4.5>Prime cost = raw material + direct labor. Operating expenses = distribution expenses
        <br/>
        
        
         <h2>Production cost</h2>
       <FONT SIZE=4.5>Production costs (also called operating costs) are the expenses necessary to maintain a project, processing line or equipment in operation. In a standard company, the difference between income (from sales and other inputs) and the cost of production indicates gross profit.
        
      <p>production cost = prime cost + direct manufacturing overhead + indirect costs</p>.<br/>
        
        
         <h2>Indirect costs</h2>
        The indirect cost is one of the types of costs that affects the production process of one or several products that the company subsequently sells. But what really characterizes these costs is that they can not be assigned directly to each of the products. That is, if you produce cars, you know that in each car, you will need as raw material, 4 wheels, for example. However, this is not possible to do with the indirect costs. It will be done only after having defined a coherent allocation criterion, which allows you to calculate your allocation to each product individually, which will guide you later when defining the final sale price.
       <p>Indirect costs = indirect raw material + indirect labor + indirect overhead costs</p>. <br/>
        
    
         <h2>Distribution costs</h2>
        
        Distribution costs are all disbursements incurred by a producer to deliver its products, from its manufacturing plant to the place where they are acquired, thus constituting a fundamental component of the total cost to the producer and the price paid by the producers. consumers, so their analysis is very important in terms of business efficiency.
        <p>Distribution costs = sales expenses + administration expenses. </p> <br/>
        
        
         <h2>Operating costs</h2>
        he notion of operating expenses refers to the money disbursed by a company or organization in the development of its activities. Operating expenses are salaries, rent of premises, purchase of supplies and others.
        In other words, operating expenses are those that are used to maintain an asset in its existing condition or to modify it so that it is again in proper working conditions.

Operating expenses can be divided into administrative expenses (salaries, office services), financial expenses (interest, check issuance), sunken expenses (made before the start of operations inherent to the activities) and representation expenses (gifts, trips, meals).


 
Operating expenses are also known as indirect expenses, since they involve expenses related to the operation of the business but are not investments (such as the purchase of a machine).

Recall that, in the economic sense, an investment is the placement of capital that is made to achieve a future gain. Investment implies the resignation of an immediate benefit for a future one.

Operating expenses, on the other hand, are allocated to the operation of the business and do not materialize pending a future benefit, but its function is to allow the subsistence of the commercial activity (which, of course, is intended to be profitable and award profits).

For example: the purchase of five computers by a company is an investment. However, the daily expenditure on printing cartridges, sheets and electricity is part of the operating expenses.

Accounting classification of the term

Another classification of this concept, from the accounting point of view, can refer to the expenses that a certain entity makes to exist as such, that is, to operate in a certain trade.

Operating expenses Within this definition, operating expenses can be: sales (those whose purpose is to increase profits from commercial exchange, within this classification would be supplies, commissions, advertising, among others), administration ( to be able to operate it is necessary that a series of essential procedures are performed to constitute as an organization, within these expenses include the payroll of employees, fees, etc.) and manufacturing (all costs of labor and material to be able to develop the productive task, within these expenses may include the purchase of raw materials, machinery and labor).
        
        <p>Total cost of operation = production cost + distribution cost.</p><br/>
        
        
        
         <h2>Unit production costs</h2>
        The unit cost is the average value that, at a certain volume of production, costs to produce a unit of the product. It is obtained by dividing the total cost of production (sum of the fixed and variable costs) by the total quantity produced. Production cost.
        <p> Unit cost of production = cost of production / unit of production</p><br/>
